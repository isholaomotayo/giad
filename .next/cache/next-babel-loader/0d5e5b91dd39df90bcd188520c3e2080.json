This population suggests a massive potential workforce as well as a huge consumer base. For  a manufacturer, this is an ideal scenario, not only do you have potential customers, but you also have potential employees. The Nigerian government is eager to expand the manufacturing capability in the country, and to that end, they are offering incentives for manufacturers that are able to locally source their raw materials, for example, agro-allied manufacturers processing foodstuffs such as fruit juices and vegetable oils. Any manufacturing industry that provides multiplier effect solutions for the economy is also looked upon favorably. An example of this would be machine tools, flat sheet metal, and spare parts manufacturing.\n      Finally, any investment in research institutes, especially those that focus on adaptive research and commercialization of local inventions, is looked upon favorably by the Nigerian government.\n      `,\n  linkUrl: '#1',\n  linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  menuItem: 'Agriculture',\n  image: thumbImage2,\n  slogan: 'Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Nigerian Economy',\n  title: `We’ve funded <strong>19,571</strong> \n    water projects for \n    <strong>6.7 million</strong> people\n    around the world.`,\n  description: `Nearly one-third of all employed Nigerians find themselves working in the agricultural sector, which is one of the country's main foreign exchange earners.

Not only will locally grow foodstuffs be promoted on behalf of the investor, business and enabling companies may receive the pioneer company status and qualify for tax incentives. Subsidies on fertilizer and zero import duties on raw materials needed to manufacture livestock feed are some of the other incentives to attract investors to this sector. Another is the release of grants from the Raw Materials Research and Development Council for research and development that leads to the greater domestic use of Nigeria's raw materials.`,\n  linkUrl: '#1',\n  linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  menuItem: 'Investments',\n  image: thumbImage,\n  slogan: 'Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Nigerian Economy',\n  title: `We’ve funded <strong>29,725</strong> \n    water projects for \n    <strong>8.4 million</strong> people\n    around the world.`,\n  description: `The Nigerian economy is poised for unprecedented growth. With the rebasing of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Federal Government of Nigeria is encouraging the private sector to take the lead in investment. With improvements in key economic indicators and Nigeria's status as a relatively stable economic center in Africa, the importance of improvements to Nigeria's requires little explanation. Nigeria, with its large economy, oil and gas resources and access to international capital flows, provides an ideal base from which to acquire additional investments in the region.\n      The past years have been one of economic progress in Nigeria, with Africa's largest economy managing to crawl back into growth territory in the second quarter of 2017. The Nigerian government has realized that they need to make the country as attractive and lucrative as possible for offshore investors to bring their capital, skills and business trade into the country`,\n  linkUrl: '#1',\n  linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\n}, {\n  id: 4,\n  menuItem: 'ICT',\n  image: thumbImage3,\n  slogan: 'Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Nigerian Economy',\n  title: `We’ve funded <strong>10,792</strong> \n    water projects for \n    <strong>4.9 million</strong> people\n    around the world.`,\n  description: 'Nigeria is one of the fastest growing internet users in the world.

At present, there is an opportunity for private education to offer specific programs that are in demand in the country. Nigeria is a country with vast underemployment and by offering distance learning or night schools, there is potential for strong investment returns in for profit education.\n      As an example, one can look at the success of Curro in South Africa, which began as a private for-profit primary and secondary schools but now even has a post-secondary offering. If a Nigerian model were created that focused on skills development, the potential returns could be very lucrative. Nigeria is in the fortunate position to offer investment opportunities to both local and international persons and companies. The need to develop the Nigerian economy offers lucrative potential returns for those looking to invest in the above sectors, including manufacturing and private education. These areas are in some ways interconnected, and by increasing the investment and development in one area, there is tremendous potential for spillover into the other, sectors.\n      `,\n  linkUrl: '#1',\n  linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\n}];\n/* ------------------------------------ */\n// Work feature data\n\n/* ------------------------------------ */\n\nimport mapPin from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/map-pin.svg';\nimport searchIcon from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/search-icon.svg';\nimport studying from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/studying.svg';\nexport const workData = {\n  title: 'Our Key Objectives',\n  slogan: `The general objectives include: promotion of disaster prevention, reduction and management, good environment in Africa.

This population suggests a massive potential workforce as well as a huge consumer base. For  a manufacturer, this is an ideal scenario, not only do you have potential customers, but you also have potential employees. The Nigerian government is eager to expand the manufacturing capability in the country, and to that end, they are offering incentives for manufacturers that are able to locally source their raw materials, for example, agro-allied manufacturers processing foodstuffs such as fruit juices and vegetable oils. Any manufacturing industry that provides multiplier effect solutions for the economy is also looked upon favorably. An example of this would be machine tools, flat sheet metal, and spare parts manufacturing.\r\n      Finally, any investment in research institutes, especially those that focus on adaptive research and commercialization of local inventions, is looked upon favorably by the Nigerian government.\r\n      `,\r\n    linkUrl: '#1',\r\n    linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 2,\r\n    menuItem: 'Agriculture',\r\n    image: thumbImage2,\r\n    slogan: 'Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Nigerian Economy',\r\n    title: `We’ve funded <strong>19,571</strong> \r\n    water projects for \r\n    <strong>6.7 million</strong> people\r\n    around the world.`,\r\n    description: `Nearly one-third of all employed Nigerians find themselves working in the agricultural sector, which is one of the country's main foreign exchange earners.

Subsidies on fertilizer and zero import duties on raw materials needed to manufacture livestock feed are some of the other incentives to attract investors to this sector.

Nigeria, with its large economy, oil and gas resources and access to international capital flows, provides an ideal base from which to acquire additional investments in the region.\r\n      The past years have been one of economic progress in Nigeria, with Africa's largest economy managing to crawl back into growth territory in the second quarter of 2017.

At present, there is an opportunity for private education to offer specific programs that are in demand in the country. Nigeria is a country with vast underemployment and by offering distance learning or night schools, there is potential for strong investment returns in for profit education.\r\n      As an example, one can look at the success of Curro in South Africa, which began as a private for-profit primary and secondary schools but now even has a post-secondary offering. If a Nigerian model were created that focused on skills development, the potential returns could be very lucrative. Nigeria is in the fortunate position to offer investment opportunities to both local and international persons and companies. The need to develop the Nigerian economy offers lucrative potential returns for those looking to invest in the above sectors, including manufacturing and private education. These areas are in some ways interconnected, and by increasing the investment and development in one area, there is tremendous potential for spillover into the other, sectors.\r\n      `,\r\n    linkUrl: '#1',\r\n    linkText: 'SEE MORE OF OUR IMPACT'\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\n/* ------------------------------------ */\r\n// Work feature data\r\n/* ------------------------------------ */\r\nimport mapPin from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/map-pin.svg';\r\nimport searchIcon from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/search-icon.svg';\r\nimport studying from '../../../../common/src/assets/image/charity/studying.svg';\r\n\r\nexport const workData = {\r\n  title: 'Our Key Objectives',\r\n  slogan: `The general objectives include: promotion of disaster prevention, reduction and management, good environment in Africa.
